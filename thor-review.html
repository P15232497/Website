<p>Thor: Ragnarok is directed by Taika Waitit and is the third entry in the Thor franchise, while also being the seventeenth entry into the evergrowing Marvel universe.
  Imprisoned by the seemingly insane grandmaster, Thor must fight for his survival in order to return to his home of Asgard, before it's destroyed by the impending doom that is Hela the Goddess of Death. </p>
<br> </br>
<p> Unlike his previous solo escapades Thor: Ragnarok is stocked with an abundance of silliness and over the top humor, that at times borders on the preposterous, something that after all,
  Marvel films essentially are. This substantial change in tone from the previously tedious entries into the Thor mythos is a prime example of Marvel's ever-shifting tone towards comedy opposed to drama.
  They're not trying to create something serious or grounded in reality like the D.C films, and that's the reason Marvel is currently ahead and probably always will be. They aren’t afraid to be themselves. </p>
<br> </br>
<p>However, this laid-back approach can at times undermine what is one of comic book's most disastrous and bloody editions.
Even the idea of Ragnarok is one of biblical destruction. As the gods fall foul to pure evil - In this incarnation played by the all concurring Cate Blanchett.
These are where the problems arise, Marvel's obsession with becoming a comedic delight can't always transcend to each and every film. </p>
<br> </br>
<p>This increased level of humor - to almost spoof-like levels - also masks what is at times a crowded narrative.
With a story that feels like a momentous epic being forced into a brief 130-minute runtime. In a purely narrative sense Waititi may have bitten of more than he can chew with Ragnarok,
forcing himself into a corner where the only escape is to include endless amounts of exposition. And although exposition isn’t always an atrocious storytelling technique it is undoubtedly a lazy one.  </p>
<br> </br>
<p>That being said in almost every other regard Waitit and the Marvel team hit the metaphorical ball out of the park.
The battle sequences within Thor: Ragnarok, in particular, are a standout example of Waitit's credentials behind the camera.
Choreographed seamlessly, yet not too overzealous that they become a dance the sequences are both memorable and shocking. Each hit feels real where other comic book adaptations have felt fake.
This is, of course, helped when the sequences are backed by actors who take great pride and passion into every role.
None more so than Cate Blanchett. </p>
<br> </br>
<p>And who could forget the man himself, Jeff Goldblum. If Blanchett’s the queen of charisma then Goldblum is unquestionably the king.
With so many memorable performances to his name already, ranging from Ian Malcolm Jurassic Park, David Levinson Independence Day, Deputy Kovacs The Grand Budapest Hotel to a hilariously inspired cameo in the TV series Friends.
It’s credit to his magnitude that he can still produce performance after performance that will resonate with audiences of all ages.
His stint as the grandmaster although short - which would be the only complaint - is one of the most memorable performances in the Marvel Universe so far.
His laid-back, charming person feels so gleefully left of center for a character who holds peoples lives in the balance, treating them like a game.
Goldblum's relationship with his grunt-like enforcer Topaz (Rachel House) is a distinct highlight in a performance stocked with them. </p>
<br> </br>
<p>However, there is an underlining issue with both Godblum's and Blanchett's characters which is simply a lack of screentime.
With the two of them fighting over it as if Vultures over a carcass. With a film stocked full of characters, this was always going to be an underlining issue, with stars being pushed back to simple cameos.
Regrettably, the more compelling characters have been swept aside to make room for the less enchanting. Particularly that of Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie. Her performance isn’t disappointing per say.
If anything the opposite, as she excels with a character that feels underdeveloped. She’s just not as inquisitive or bold as the others. Especially not the brilliantly hilarious Korg who’s worth mentioning more than once. His inclusion alone is enough motivation to purchase a ticket. </p>
<br> </br>
<p>Although Thor: Ragnarok may break little to no new ground within the Marvel mythos it certainly doesn't disappoint.
This surprisingly vulgar inclusion into the series will stand out as one of the most comedic and vibrant entries. </p>
<br> </br>
<p>Rating 8/10 </p>
