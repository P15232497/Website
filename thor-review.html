       <h1 class="title">Thor: Ragnarok Review</h1>
       <img class="sticky" src="Images/thor.jpg" alt="Avatar">

Thor: Ragnarok is directed by Taika Waitit and is the third entry in the Thor franchise, while also being the seventeenth entry into the evergrowing Marvel universe. Imprisoned by the seemingly insane grandmaster, Thor must fight for his survival in order to return to his home of Asgard, before it's destroyed by the impending doom that is Hela the Goddess of Death.

Unlike his previous solo escapades Thor: Ragnarok is stocked with an abundance of silliness and over the top humor, that at times borders on the preposterous, something that after all, Marvel films essentially are. This substantial change in tone from the previously tedious entries into the Thor mythos is a prime example of Marvel's ever-shifting tone towards comedy opposed to drama. They're not trying to create something serious or grounded in reality like the D.C films, and that's the reason Marvel is currently ahead and probably always will be. They aren’t afraid to be themselves.

However, this laid-back approach can at times undermine what is one of comic book's most disastrous and bloody editions. Even the idea of Ragnarok is one of biblical destruction. As the gods fall foul to pure evil - In this incarnation played by the all concurring Cate Blanchett. These are where the problems arise, Marvel's obsession with becoming a comedic delight can't always transcend to each and every film. Although it undoubtedly works in Thor: Ragnarok - producing laugh out loud moments by the bucket load - more often than not it feels out of place, forced into the action by a directed renowned for his comedic escapades. Yes, we are treated to potentially one of cinemas greatest ever comedic relief characters in Korg, a walking talking mound of rocks, surprisingly voiced by Waitit himself, showcasing his enormity in both regards. But the film still feels forced in regards to its humor.

This increased level of humor - to almost spoof-like levels - also masks what is at times a crowded narrative. With a story that feels like a momentous epic being forced into a brief 130-minute runtime. In a purely narrative sense Waititi may have bitten of more than he can chew with Ragnarok, forcing himself into a corner where the only escape is to include endless amounts of exposition. And although exposition isn’t always an atrocious storytelling technique it is undoubtedly a lazy one.

That being said in almost every other regard Waitit and the Marvel team hit the metaphorical ball out of the park. The battle sequences within Thor: Ragnarok, in particular, are a standout example of Waitit's credentials behind the camera. Choreographed seamlessly, yet not too overzealous that they become a dance the sequences are both memorable and shocking. Each hit feels real where other comic book adaptations have felt fake. This is, of course, helped when the sequences are backed by actors who take great pride and passion into every role. None more so than Cate Blanchett.

What's left to say about Blanchett? Not only is she immensely talented, she never rests on her laurels, throwing herself into every role as if it were her first. Her memorable depiction of the vindictive Hela is just the character Marvel where crying out for. A strong, powerful and intimidating villain that can bring fear into the eyes of her superhero counterparts. A realistic challenge for rather untested heroes. Blanchett's performance is produced with a sense of vigor unforeseen by a villain in Marvels MCU, and very reminiscent of Robin Wrights turn as Clair Underwood in the hit series House Of Cards. Walking into a franchise 17 films in and commanding every scene without a brush of the shoulders. And although the goddess of deaths powers remain rather underdeveloped, Hela's early introduction into the Marvel universe shows good signs for what is sure to be a long and lucrative partnership.

Blanchett’s performance isn’t the only one worth mentioning, however, as Hemsworth's reprisal of his famed character Thor is altogether improved from his previous outings that left the character feeling like an athletic hunk and not much else. This time around Thor has a personality, and a fun one at that. Although his performance was undoubtedly raised with an improved and flamboyant script, it's worth remembering these are only words on a page and Hemsworth still has to translate these into a character that can be likable, entertaining, and also menacing.

And who could forget the man himself, Jeff Goldblum. If Blanchett’s the queen of charisma then Goldblum is unquestionably the king. With so many memorable performances to his name already, ranging from Ian Malcolm Jurassic Park, David Levinson Independence Day, Deputy Kovacs The Grand Budapest Hotel to a hilariously inspired cameo in the TV series Friends. It’s credit to his magnitude that he can still produce performance after performance that will resonate with audiences of all ages. His stint as the grandmaster although short - which would be the only complaint - is one of the most memorable performances in the Marvel Universe so far. His laid-back, charming person feels so gleefully left of center for a character who holds peoples lives in the balance, treating them like a game. Goldblum's relationship with his grunt-like enforcer Topaz (Rachel House) is a distinct highlight in a performance stocked with them.

However, there is an underlining issue with both Godblum's and Blanchett's characters which is simply a lack of screentime. With the two of them fighting over it as if Vultures over a carcass. With a film stocked full of characters, this was always going to be an underlining issue, with stars being pushed back to simple cameos. Regrettably, the more compelling characters have been swept aside to make room for the less enchanting. Particularly that of Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie. Her performance isn’t disappointing per say. If anything the opposite, as she excels with a character that feels underdeveloped. She’s just not as inquisitive or bold as the others. Especially not the brilliantly hilarious Korg who’s worth mentioning more than once. His inclusion alone is enough motivation to purchase a ticket.

Visually the film is also a spectacle, unlike many other Marvel film's it goes supersonic with the vibrancy. The forgotten land in which Thor is imprisoned and forced to become a warrior of the ring is depicted in a visual style which shares similarities to the lushes environment evident in the Guardians of the Galaxy films. Not only are the visuals a delight for the eyes, they also build on the narrative and tone the director is trying to produce. Even the musical score which is very 80’s techno arcade style links perfectly to the comedic playful tone created by this lush video game-esque environment created by the grandmaster.

Nevertheless, at times the CGI isn’t perfect, instead feeling painfully average to the level that some scenes wouldn’t look out of place on the SyFy channel. Particular evident in one sequence, which is supposed to be lavished with emotion, forcing the audience to reach for the tissue boxes, but ultimately instead harboring the opposite effect, as we look on in ore at our heroes staring aimlessly into a painfully obvious green screen. Considering the substantial budget behind Thor: Ragnarok you'd be forgiven for thinking this dreadful CGI was deliberate. Surely this wouldn't make it through the editing processes. However, we'll never know and it will remain a blip on an otherwise mesmeric film.

Although Thor: Ragnarok may break little to no new ground within the Marvel mythos it certainly doesn't disappoint. This surprisingly vulgar inclusion into the series will stand out as one of the most comedic and vibrant entries.

Rating 8/10
