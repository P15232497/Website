<p> IT is directed by Andy Muschietti and is the feature length film adaptation of Stephen Kings culture defining book of the same name.
  Set in the fictional city of Derry Maine, we follow a group of 7 friends brought together by their unpopularity as they attempt to survive the murderous rampage of a child killing clown called Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard).</p>
<br> </br>
<p>In the build up to IT there was an almost unprecedented level of anticipation, held both critics and fans.
  When a film has this much hype with nothing but positives being heard it can sometimes end up being underwhelming.
  Not necessarily a bad movie per say, but just not as impressive as we had been made to believe. </p>
<br> </br>
  <p>IT however not only lives up to the expectations but manages to exceed them.
  Everything that was so memorable and impressive about the original mini series is back but this time ramped up to eleven. </p>
<br> </br>
<p>There's also something to be said for the way the film stays true to Stephen Kings original novel.
  Unlike some other adaptions of kings "Cough Cough" The Dark Tower.
  IT doesn't jumble up the story or create a completely new narrative. </p>
<br> </br>
  <p>The majority of the books story is include in the film, with only a few changes made at points that really wouldn't work on the big screen.
  The director also knew when to keep the film grounded (as grounded as a film about a shape shifting killer clown can be) There's no flying tortoise in this adaption.
  Now let's get into the film and what ultimately makes it one of if not the best horror film this century. </p>
<br> </br>
<p>IT is a must watch for all Horror fans, Stephen King fans and really just everyone.
  With a refreshing take on the horror franchise that steps away from some of the more frustrating tropes and instead focuses on character and storytelling, its one of the best films this year. </P>
<br> </br>
<p>Rating 8/10</p>
