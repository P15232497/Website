  <p>The Dark Tower is directed by Nikolaj Arcel and is based on a series of books written by Stephen King.
    This film adaptation follows Jake (Tom Taylor) a young boy who after dreaming of another world beyond his is suddenly thrown into it.
    Once in this unknown world he must team up with Roland (Idris Elba) the last gunslinger in an attempt to defeat The Man in Black (Mathew McConaughey) and his evil army from destroying all civilisation as we know it.  </P>

  <p>Going into the film I hadn't read any of the books in Stephen Kings Dark Tower series, if anything this is probably an advantage as the film takes aspects from all 8 books and implements them in this one film.
    This is where fans of the source material are going to have major issues with The Dark Tower.
    It doesn't stay true to the books and that's a dangerous road to take when making an adaptation of a beloved series from an amazing author such as Stephen King.  </P>
<br> </br>
  <p> The Dark tower has a lot of good ideas that unfortunately are just executed in a way that makes the film very average, its not something you are going to be thinking about for days, if anything you might forget about it after a couple of hours after  leaving the cinema.
    The film also feels watered down in a ploy to attract a bigger audience, not just in the way that no proper violence is shown.
    Plot points that could've been expanded with more imagination seem dumbed down in a way to draw in a younger audience and ultimately make more money.
    This is extremely frustrating because you're primary focus should be on making the best film possible, the money will then come from that, it should be an after thought. </P>
<br> </br>
  <p>If you're a Stephen King fan and have read the books then I would certainly say stay away from this film, it wasn't really made for the fans of the books, which is disappointing and in hindsight I'm sure the production team will regret this.
    If however you haven't read any of the books like myself this might be a film you are interested in, its fun and a good way to pass the time but unfortunately thats all it ever will be. </P>

  <p> Rating 5/10</P>
