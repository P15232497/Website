  <p> The best aspects of Justice League are the chemistry between its cast and the film’s individual depiction of each superhero.
      Unlike in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, these characters, Batman included, are decidedly heroic instead of unlikable and impersonal.
  <br> </br>
  <p>They make an effort to save civilians and spare lives, and, ahem, come together to help each other.
  Justice League has some good moments and some bad ones, but it ultimately ekes out just enough entertainment value to warrant a look-see. </P>
  <br> </br>
<p>That said, Justice League seldom delivers any truly “wow!” moments of finally seeing these awesome superheroes assembled together onscreen the way The Avengers did.
  This first big screen union of DC Comics’ top-tier superheroes is ultimately just an adequate adventure flick.
  It’s marred by a very choppy story, a run-of-the-mill villain, some shoddy visual effects, and an overall haphazard execution. </P>
  <br> </br>
  <p>Warner Bros. and DC Films had two major goals to achieve with Justice League. First, to cleanse the palette of those turned off by the relentlessly grim BvS; and second, to make viewers enjoy these superheroes enough to want to see further screen appearances by them.
     Justice League mostly succeeds in accomplishing those two key objectives, despite its sloppy execution.
     It’s messy and flawed but it still offers enough entertainment value (mostly thanks to its likable characters) to make it worthwhile. </P>
  <br> </br>
  <p>Rating 7/10</p>
