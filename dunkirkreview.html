  <p> Dunkirk is a film based on true events from 1940 during WWII, in which 400,000 allied soldiers where trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk trying to get back to England.
    War films especially when based upon true events are extremely hard to pull off,
  Dunkirk does pull it off, this is potentially the most realistic depiction of war ever put to the big screen. It doesn't glorify it. </P>
  <br> </br>
  <p> It doesn't linger on gore or extreme violence, it just shows you what it would have been like to on that beach, how little hope you would have had.
  You feel when watching the film that you're there, that you're part of whats happening, and thats very difficult to accomplish when making a film. </P>
  <br> </br>
  <p> The film follows four storylines about different people which all coincide with each other.
  This decision by Nolan when writing the screenplay was a master stroke as all the characters are really different so it gives you a view into all the differing emotions and decisions made during the war. </P>
  <br> </br>
  <p> There are some issue with the movie however, the characters where disappointing.
  There wasn't that one character that really grabs your attention, that one performance that really stands out which has you talking afterwards.
  We don't get much time to learn about the characters, so you don't really connect with them in a way that you have with characters in war films before. </P>
  <br> </br>
  <p> Dialogue in the movie is very sparse, which some people will take issue with as don't learn a lot about anyone, however this is what war would be like.
  Its not a people sat round a fire talking about home and what they are going to do when they get back, these are people that don't know each other and are thinking they might never get home. </P>
  <br> </br>
  <p> This is film thats a must see in IMAX, thats the only way you will really feel the full immersion that was intended by Nolan,
  I did feel a little underwhelmed coming out after all the hype so make sure to keep your expectations realistic, but don't get me wrong this is a fantastic film and sure favourite for best picture this year.</P>
